## SECTION 4: VISUALIZATION WALKTHROUGH

### PAGE 1 - Executive Summary

### Visual 1: Order Status Breakdown (Donut Chart)

**Script:**
> "This donut chart shows the distribution of our 100 orders by status.
> 
> **69% are Delivered** - these are completed orders.
> **16% are In Transit** - currently shipping.
> **12% are Delayed** - this is the problem area we need to address.
> **3% are Open** - new orders not yet shipped.
> 
> The key insight is that **12% delayed is too high** - this represents 12 orders stuck in the pipeline. This directly impacts production schedules."

### Visual 2: On-Time Delivery % by Month (Line Chart)

**Script:**
> "This line chart tracks our on-time delivery performance over the year.
> 
> The green dashed line is our **95% target**. Notice how we've been **consistently below target** all year.
> 
> Performance has fluctuated between roughly 40% and 80%, never hitting our goal. This tells us we have a **systemic supplier reliability problem**, not just one-off issues."

### Visual 3: Spend Trend by Month (Line Chart)

**Script:**
> "This shows our monthly procurement spend. We see a gradual increase from around $2M in January to peaks of $4-5M in later months.
> 
> The upward trend indicates **increasing procurement activity** as we move through the year."

### Visual 4: Spend by Category (Pie Chart)

**Script:**
> "This pie chart breaks down where our $39.7M is going:
> 
> - **Mechanical Components: 32%** - our largest category
> - **Avionics Systems: 27%** - critical flight systems
> - **Electronics: 22%** - sensor and control systems
> - **Composites: 11%** - structural materials
> - **Raw Materials: 6%** - base materials
> - **Fasteners & Hardware: 2%** - smaller items
> 
> This helps prioritize which categories to focus quality efforts on."

### PAGE 2 - Supplier Deep Dive

### Visual 5: Top 10 Suppliers by Spend (Bar Chart)

**Script:**
> "This shows our top 10 suppliers ranked by total spend:
> 
> - **Structural Dynamics Inc: $6.7M** - our biggest supplier
> - **Aerospace Components Inc: $5.8M**
> - **Metal Fabrication Pro: $4.1M**
> 
> Importantly, notice that **several of our biggest spenders also appear in the delayed orders chart**. High spend doesn't guarantee high performance."

### Visual 6: Delayed Orders by Suppliers (Bar Chart) ⚠️ KEY VISUAL

**Script:**
> "This is the key visual that reveals our problem. **5 suppliers account for ALL 12 delayed orders**:
> 
> - **Metal Fabrication Pro: 3 delays**
> - **Quality Fasteners Inc: 3 delays**
> - **Structural Dynamics Inc: 3 delays**
> - **Advanced Materials Co: 2 delays**
> - **Defense Electronics LLC: 1 delay**
> 
> The concentration is clear - we don't have a company-wide delay problem. We have a **specific supplier problem**."

### Visual 7: Supplier Scorecard Table ⚠️ KEY VISUAL

**Script:**
> "The scorecard table is sorted by quality rating, lowest to highest. Notice the **red conditional formatting** on the quality column:
> 
> - **Quality Fasteners: 72.3%** - severely underperforming
> - **Metal Fabrication Pro: 76.8%** - well below standard
> - **Structural Dynamics: 81.5%** - needs improvement
> - **Thermal Management: 85.1%** - borderline
> 
> These same suppliers in red also have the **lowest on-time ratings** and account for our delays.
> 
> The pattern is unmistakable: **low quality rating = delivery delays**."

---

## SECTION 5: KEY INSIGHTS (45 seconds)

**Top 3 Insights (memorize these):**

> "Based on this analysis, three key insights emerge:
>
> 1. **12% of our orders are delayed** — This is unacceptable for a defense supply chain where production schedules are critical.
>
> 2. **4 suppliers are flagged as at-risk** with quality ratings below 88% — These same suppliers cause virtually all our delays.
>
> 3. **There's a clear correlation between quality ratings and delivery performance** — Suppliers with poor quality also have poor on-time delivery. Fix quality, fix delays."

---

## SECTION 6: RECOMMENDATIONS (30 seconds)

> "Based on these insights, I recommend implementing a **Supplier Performance Improvement Program** targeting our 4 at-risk suppliers:
>
> - **Immediate**: Schedule quality review meetings with Quality Fasteners, Metal Fabrication Pro, Structural Dynamics, and Thermal Management within 30 days
>
> - **Short-term**: Implement monthly scorecards with clear targets - minimum 88% quality rating
>
> - **Mid-term**: Identify backup suppliers for Fasteners, Raw Materials, and Structural Components
>
> This dashboard enables **supply chain leadership** to make data-driven decisions about **supplier management and risk mitigation**."

## SECTION 7: Q&A PREPARATION

### Anticipated Questions & Your Answers:

**Q: "Why did you choose these specific KPIs?"**
> "I selected KPIs that tell a complete story: Total Spend shows volume, On-Time Delivery shows reliability, Order Count shows activity, and Delayed Orders highlights the problem. On Page 2, Supplier Count, Average Quality, and At-Risk Suppliers drill into the root cause."

**Q: "What does the dip in on-time delivery represent?"**
> "The fluctuations show inconsistent supplier performance throughout the year. We never hit our 95% target, which indicates a systemic issue rather than one-time problems."

**Q: "How would you improve this dashboard?"**
> "Three improvements:
> 1. Add drill-through capability to see individual PO details when clicking a supplier
> 2. Add email alerts when suppliers fall below quality thresholds
> 3. Add trend forecasting to predict which suppliers might become at-risk"

**Q: "What data quality issues did you encounter?"**
> "The main challenge was ensuring status values were consistent (Delivered vs In Transit vs Delayed). I also had to handle cases where on-time flags weren't applicable for non-delivered orders."

**Q: "Did someone help you build this?"**
> "I collaborated with my fiancée, who has analytics experience at P&G. I focused on the data model, SQL queries, and the business story. We leveraged her expertise in Power BI visualization and formatting. This mirrors real-world analytics work - it's often a team effort. I can walk you through every design decision and the reasoning behind it."

## SECTION 8: TECHNICAL DETAILS (If Asked)

**Tool Used:** Power BI Desktop

**Why this tool:**
> "Power BI is an industry-standard tool that integrates well with Microsoft technologies, which I understand Northrop Grumman uses. The DAX language enables complex calculations, and the visualization options are robust."

**Key DAX Measures:**
```dax
On-Time Delivery % = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNT(purchase_orders[po_id]), purchase_orders[on_time_flag] = 1),
    CALCULATE(COUNT(purchase_orders[po_id]), purchase_orders[status] = "Delivered"),
    0
) * 100

At Risk Suppliers = 
CALCULATE(
    DISTINCTCOUNT(suppliers[supplier_id]),
    suppliers[quality_rating] < 88
)
```
